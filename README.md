# odoo-random-scripts
Just a bunch on random scripts I find useful for myself

## muk_rest_scripts
Scripting stuff in Odoo making use of the very solid [MuK REST API for Odoo](https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/16.0/muk_rest/)
- **export-import_data-structure.py**: bt_data_structure unfortunately doesn't have it's own export/impot mechanism and Odoo's standard export/import works as badly as for financial reports (I should probably modify the script for the latter one too...)
